    "themes": ["Regret", "Identity", "Apocalypse"],
    "shortDescription": "A wandering android in a decaying world, slowly realizing his role in why everything is collapsing.",
    "synopsis": "In a ruined future where robots and humans are both succumbing to a mysterious 'Ruin', Casshern travels across desolate landscapes, meeting people who blame him for the end of the world. The show is episodic, reflective, and gives you emotional punches through quiet encounters rather than fast plot twists.",

    "shortDescription": "Two enigmatic teens stage elaborate attacks in Tokyo, treating the city like a puzzle to be solved.",
    "synopsis": "The series follows 'Nine' and 'Twelve', two boys behind cryptic terror attacks, and Lisa, a lonely girl who gets dragged into their plans. The focus is on tension, moral ambiguity, and how society and media react, rather than on big mystery twists alone.",

    "themes": ["Hope", "Despair", "Sacrifice"],
    "shortDescription": "Looks like a typical magical-girl show at first, but gradually turns into something much heavier.",
    "synopsis": "Madoka and her friends are offered the chance to become magical girls in exchange for a single wish. As they learn more about what that really means, the tone shifts from cute to tragic, exploring the cost of wishes, fate, and repeating timelines. Knowing it gets dark is fine — the card avoids explicit late-series spoilers.",

    "shortDescription": "Post-grad drifters juggle part-time jobs and stuck feelings while trying to figure out adulthood.",
    "synopsis": "Rikuo, an ex-student working at a convenience store, crosses paths with an eccentric girl and an old crush. The show focuses on awkward conversations, unresolved relationships, and small choices rather than big dramatic twists. Good if you like slow emotional burn over plot-heavy storytelling.",

    "shortDescription": "A special-ops unit handles crimes in a wired future where humans and machines deeply overlap.",
    "synopsis": "Section 9 investigates cybercrimes and political scandals in a society where 'ghosts' (consciousness) can live in fully artificial bodies. Many episodes are stand-alone, with arcs like the Laughing Man tying things together. You get action plus slow, thoughtful episodes about what it means to be human.",
